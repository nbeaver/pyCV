Keep track of planned and completed features here,
especially things not directly related to the code so that it doesn't become cluttered.

[*] implement debouncing
[ ] add command line flag parsing
    [ ] add --help flag
    [ ] add --debug flag
    [ ] add flags for color and which plots to overlay
[*] make the opened file configurable from commandline
[*] parse EZStat potentiostat data instead of the simpler CSV file
[ ] put output images into a folder instead of dumping them all into the current directory
[ ] separate the parsing from the rest of the code so that it can read from other data files
[ ] add another plot with each detected cycle plotted together in different colors
